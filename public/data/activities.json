It could be an action from a sport, a job, or an everyday activity (e.g., holding a steering wheel, casting a fishing rod).\n\n3. Student C looks at Student A and gives verbal instructions to Student B. Student C must describe the pose exactly so Student B can copy it. For example: 'Lift your right arm. Bend your elbow. Make a fist.'\n\n4. Student B must listen carefully and try to mirror Student A's pose without looking.\n\n5. When the instructions are finished, Students A and B can turn around and compare poses. Then, switch roles!",
